          %p
            Currently our primary focus will be to build and encourage building of applications in #{link_to_blank "Ruby on Rails", "http://rubyonrails.org/"} which is an awesome technology
            to build web applications but we will support other technologies too as we grow.

            There are a lot of social problems to solve which may not earn money but it will earn us a better world to live in. We will be able to
            make a better world for our children and their children to live in. We will run RFC using contributions made by RFC volunteers and
            various sponsorships and donations from companies and governments.

          %h4 What are the different kinds of open source project licences?
          %p
            There are many different kinds of open source licences. But all of them fall into 3 main categories.
            Largely Restrictive - example, GNU Public Licence. GPL entails that people should not make any profits from the open source software at all.
            Less Restrictive - example, Apache Licence. People can make profits out of using AL kind of licences, just that they have to give credits to
            people who made the softwares.
            Non-Restrictive - example, MIT Licence.
