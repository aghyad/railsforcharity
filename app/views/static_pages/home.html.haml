            %p
              %ol
                %li We want to incubate, foster, develop, mentor and support web based software projects which could potentially have a social impact.
                %br
                %li We want to fix the social problems that surround us through the use of our skills (Technology) and give something back to the society.
                %br
                %li Provide a platform for people to share/pitch their social impacting ideas, get help and be helped for achieving their goals.
                %br
                %li Many people work tirelessly to bring about a change they want, but these efforts are localized and individualistic (person or company) with little collaboration and sharing of knowledge & resources. So, we want to provide a single place for all such people  to collaborate and grow together faster. In short provide a platform for people who help others.
                %br
                %li We want to make Silicon Valley the starting point for such a unique open source initiative.
